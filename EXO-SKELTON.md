🔥 UNLEASH THE FUTURE WITH EXO-ARM DESIGN INTELLIGENCE™ 🔥

The Transparent-Silicon Solar Exoskeleton Revolution

Welcome to the next generation of biomechanical enhancement — a fully redefined 
solar-powered robotic exoskeleton arm, engineered to empower human laborers, engineers,
and operators with machine-grade strength, endurance, and intelligence, all while respecting natural human anatomy. 
This system is based on the original robotic arm concept — but redesigned from the ground up to integrate directly with the human body.

🚀 ENGINEERED FOR HUMAN-AUGMENTED PRECISION

✅ BASELINE ANATOMICAL FIT (5'9" Male Build / 175 cm)

To provide ergonomic exoskeletal coverage from shoulder to fingertip, we modeled the frame using average limb data:

Wrist to fingertip	~7.5–8 inches (19–20 cm)
Full limb span	~36–38 inches (91–97 cm)
Inner circumference	~12–14 inches (upper arm)

🔧 Recommended Dimensions for Build:

    Shell thickness: 1.5–2.0 mm (doped silicon)

    Shoulder Harness Width: 6.5 inches (165 mm)
